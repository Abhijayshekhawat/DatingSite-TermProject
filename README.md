CIS 3342 Team Project â€“ Core MVC Web Application & Web APIs
Overview
This project is designed to showcase your understanding of the techniques and concepts learned in the CIS 3342 course. You will work in teams of two to develop an ASP.NET Core MVC Web application, implementing key features such as login and registration systems, Web APIs, dynamic data displays, and more.

Project Features
ASP.NET Core MVC Requirement
The project involves converting an existing ASP.NET Web Application (from Project 3) to an ASP.NET Core MVC application using Razor Views.

Login & Registration
Login: The login page allows users to log in or register a new account. Cookie support is implemented for faster logins. Users can also recover their username or password.
Registration: The registration process creates a new user account with a unique username and email. The system includes security questions for account recovery and two-step verification via email.
Web API Integration
Custom Web APIs: You will build and integrate at least 2 RESTful Web APIs that perform HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. The APIs will use custom types (JSON/XML) and be consumed by the server-side code.
Third-Party Web API: The project must also integrate a third-party Web API, approved by the instructor.
Other Requirements
Stored Procedures: All database operations are performed using stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.
Multiple Images: Users can upload multiple profile images, which are displayed in a photo gallery on the profile detail page.
Dynamic Data Displays: Razor Views must feature dynamic, professional-looking content presentation, especially for user profiles and galleries.
Security: Sensitive data such as passwords are encrypted using methods beyond those demonstrated in class.
Serialization: The project must creatively use serialization and deserialization for data persistence beyond Web API serialization.
Learning Opportunity: Each team member will research and implement a new feature not covered in class, such as dynamic charts or SOAP ASMX services.
CSS Styling: The application must be styled using CSS and include images to create an attractive and professional design.
Navigation System
Provide a user-friendly and professional navigation system on all pages.

Design & Development Guidelines
Component-based design: Use reusable components, classes, and functions instead of embedding logic in GUI/controller classes.
Equal Contribution: Both team members must contribute equally to design, database, APIs, and other project components.
