CIS 3342 Team Project – Core MVC Web Application & Web APIs
Overview
This project was developed as part of the CIS 3342 course, where my teammate and I applied all the techniques and concepts we learned throughout the semester. Our goal was to build a fully functional ASP.NET Core MVC Web application, incorporating features such as user login and registration, Web APIs, dynamic data displays, and secure data handling. We also focused on utilizing modern web development practices, including Razor Views, Web API integration, and the use of third-party APIs.

Project Contributions
ASP.NET Core MVC Application
We began by converting the ASP.NET Web Application we developed in Project 3 into an ASP.NET Core MVC application. My teammate and I worked together to replace the ASPX pages with Razor Views to give the application a more modern and efficient front-end. I focused on the back-end integration with APIs, while my teammate handled much of the front-end Razor View design, ensuring consistency and ease of navigation.

Login & Registration System
We implemented a login and registration system that supports cookie-based login for faster access. This included adding features like retrieving a forgotten username or password and a two-step email verification process for new registrations. I was primarily responsible for setting up the security questions and handling two-step verification through the Web API, while my teammate handled the design and logic for storing and retrieving cookies.

Web API Development
Our project required the development of at least two Web APIs. We worked together to design RESTful APIs that perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These APIs use custom user-defined types for data exchange in JSON format. I built the server-side logic for making Web API requests from the Razor Views, while my teammate focused on ensuring the APIs were secure and efficient. Together, we also integrated a third-party Web API to meet the project’s requirement, and I ensured that the Web APIs were properly utilized in our application without relying on client-side code.

Multiple Profile Images & Dynamic Data Displays
One of the key features of our application is the ability to upload and display multiple profile images. My teammate implemented the image upload and gallery features for user profiles, while I worked on the dynamic data display and content layout. We ensured that the photo gallery was visually appealing and easy to navigate when viewing detailed profiles.

Stored Procedures & Security
We used stored procedures for all database operations to ensure security and prevent SQL injection attacks. I handled most of the database interactions and encryption of sensitive data, such as passwords, using more advanced encryption techniques than those demonstrated in class. My teammate worked on optimizing the stored procedures for performance and security.

Serialization & Learning Opportunity
As part of the project requirements, we implemented serialization and deserialization for data persistence. I explored ways to apply serialization beyond the built-in functionality of Web APIs, using it creatively to store and retrieve data in our application. Additionally, each of us researched a new feature to implement. I explored dynamic chart generation, while my teammate learned and implemented a SOAP ASMX Web Service, both of which enhanced the overall functionality of the project.

CSS Styling & Navigation
We made sure our web application was visually appealing by using CSS and Bootstrap for styling. I contributed to styling the layout, while my teammate worked on improving the navigation system to ensure it was intuitive and user-friendly. Each page includes clear instructional labels and error messages to guide users through the site.

Equal Contribution
Throughout the project, my teammate and I made sure to split the work equally. We both contributed to the design, database, Web APIs, and styling to ensure the project was a true team effort. I focused more on back-end API integration, security, and serialization, while my teammate excelled at front-end design, image handling, and implementing the SOAP web service.

Submission
We have published our web application on the cis-iis2 Web server under the TermProject folder. The project is also submitted as a zip file on Canvas, with a detailed submission comment explaining how we implemented each project requirement and providing URLs for the relevant pages.
